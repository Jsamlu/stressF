This technique helps reduce stress, lower heart rate, and promote a sense of calm by activating the body's parasympathetic nervous system. Practicing deep breathing regularly can enhance focus, improve lung capacity, and alleviate anxiety.",

Air enters the lungs as the diaphragm strongly contracts, but unlike during traditional relaxed breathing (eupnea) the intercostal muscles of the chest do minimal work in this process. The belly also expands during this type of breathing to make room for the contraction of the diaphragm.",
